üêû Known Issues
(THIS REPO IS AN EARLY RENDITION LEADING TO TWO BUGS, WORKING WITH TEAM TO GET VERSIONS ON "PAR" pun intended hehe)
There are a few bugs or unimplemented features:

Bug #1: As per a few recent changes creating leagues and league invite-links have stopped working

Bug #2: As per a few recent changes creating tee-times have stopped working

actively navigating with the dev team to get my iteration matching, there were a few mishaps with branching.

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with fixes.
